    <p> My degree is biochemistry, afer I get my dgree I hope to go on to become a pharamacist. I enjoy reading, spending time with my family, and playing the trumpet and cello. I am taking this class because I think it is important to be able to undertand how the websites are created. I will use this information in my own life incase I need to ceate a webiste one day for myself. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Chrsit of Latter Day Saints my entire life. </p>
