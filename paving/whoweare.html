                <p>Roads and drivways all need to be built to withsand even the toughest conditions. They have to be able to withstand being snowed and then have plows come by and scrape the snow off of them. We are a company that knows what we are doing. We build the longest lasting roads around where we garuantee they will last at least 10 years with no problems or we will repave your drivway or road cost free. Our prices of asphalt is also very reasonable and easy to do. Just call us and have one of us come out to give you a free quote. Or measure the area you want paved and we will do $1.00 per square foot. so take your square footage you want paved and that his how much it will cost you to pave that area. Then depending on your thickness of asphalt for every inch of thickness you want muiltiply it by that amount of thickness. So, if you have a 2,000 square foot driveway that you want at two inches of thickness it would be 2000 times $1.00 times 2. for a total of only $4,000 dollars for a driveway that would last a garuantee of 10 years.</p>
